Amazon has a cluster of n servers. Some are in the OFF state while others are ON. The developers responsible for maintaining the servers have access to a special operation to change the states. In one operation, they can choose a contiguous sequence of servers and flip their states, i.e., ON to OFF and vice versa. Due to operational constraints, this operation can be performed on the cluster a maximum of k times.
Given a binary string server_states, of length n, where '1' represents ON, 'O' represents OFF, and an integer k, find the maximum possible number of consecutive ON servers after at most k operations.
Example
Suppose server_states = "1001", and k= 2.
The indices [1..2] can be chosen and flipped in one operation as follows:
1
3
0
3
Thus in one operation, the maximum number of consecutive ON servers is 4. It is optimal to stop after 1 operation.
Function Description
Complete the function getMaxConsecutiveON in the editor below.

Explanation
It is optimal to apply the special operations on consecutive indices (0-based indexing) as follows:
• Flip indices [O..21 giving states = "11110"
After 1 operation, there are a maximum of 4 consecutive ON servers.
• Sample Case 1
Sample Input For Custom Testing

FUNCTION
11101010110011

→
k = 2
Sample Output
8
Explanation
It is optimal to apply the special operations on consecutive indices (0-based indexing) as follows:
• Flip indices [7...91 giving states = "11101011000011"
• Flip indices [8... 11] giving states = "1110101111111"
After 2 operations, a maximum of 8 consecutive ON servers can be obtained.
